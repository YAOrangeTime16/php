# PHP / MySQL
### A Simple Content Management System

As a group project, we made a simple CMS. This application enable users to signup/singin, post articles and add/delete "like".  
  
In this project I contributed to build its signup/login system.  
  
I have put those PHP files in the "login" folder.
